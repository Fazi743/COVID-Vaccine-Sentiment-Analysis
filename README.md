# COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiment Analysis using Tweets

Welcome to the COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiment Analysis project repository. This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we aim to gain insights into public opinions, concerns, and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines.

## Project Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred worldwide interest in vaccines. This project aims to harness the power of social media data to gauge public sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines. Through sentiment analysis, we can uncover positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, contributing to a better understanding of the public perception surrounding vaccine efforts.

## Methodology

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the tweet data for analysis, including tokenization, removing stopwords, and handling special characters.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Utilizing state-of-the-art NLP techniques to determine the sentiment polarity of each tweet.
- **Visualization:** Creating visualizations to represent sentiment trends over time, common keywords, and sentiment distribution.
